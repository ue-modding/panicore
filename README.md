- [Panicore community in Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/panicore/) is a place where mods are distributed and downloaded from. Go browse what is available!
- [Thunderstore Mod Manager](https://www.overwolf.com/app/Thunderstore-Thunderstore_Mod_Manager) and [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/) are mod managers that are used to easily install and manage installed Panicore mods.
- [Palworld modding](https://pwmodding.wiki/) uses a lot of the same techniques and principles as Panicore modding. (both use UE4SS) Their docs are a great help and resource!
